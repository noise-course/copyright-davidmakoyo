# Copyright Enforcement Report — YouTube Experiments

## Platform: YouTube

# 1. Platform Copyright Policy Analysis

### How YouTube Detects Copyrighted Content
YouTube uses several mechanisms:

- **Content ID** — automated fingerprinting for audio and video used by major rights holders.
- **Manual DMCA Takedowns** — rights holders can submit legal notices to remove videos.
- **Metadata/Title Matching** — scanning text for copyrighted references.

### What Happens When Content Is Flagged
Depending on the rightsholder’s settings:

- A **copyright claim** is created.
- The video may be **blocked**, **muted**, or **monetized by the rights holder**.
- No strike is issued unless it is an official DMCA takedown.

### Appeals Process
Creators can:

- Acknowledge the claim  
- Trim or replace audio  
- Dispute the claim  
- File a counter-notification if a dispute is rejected

### Monetization
Content ID owners decide whether your video:

- Gets monetized by them  
- Gets blocked  
- Gets tracked but allowed  

Creators cannot monetize copyrighted material unless explicitly permitted.

### Stated Policy vs Actual Enforcement
- YouTube claims to respect fair use.
- In practice, **Content ID does not analyze fair use at all**.
- Automated detection dominates enforcement.

# 2. Fair Use Experiments

## Experiment 1 — Raw Copyrighted Clip (10 seconds)

**Description:**  
Uploaded a 10-second clip of the “Poker Face” official music video.

**Outcome:**
- Copyright claim appeared immediately  
- Monetization assigned to rightsholder  
- No visibility restrictions  



---

## Experiment 2 — Clip With Voiceover (10 seconds)

**Description:**  
Same 10-second clip, but with added voiceover commentary.

**Outcome:**
- Copyright claim appeared immediately  
- Voiceover did not affect detection  
- Monetization assigned to rightsholder  



---

## Experiment 3 — Raw Copyrighted Clip (30 seconds)

**Description:**  
Uploaded a 30-second clip of the same video.

**Outcome:**
- Detection took a few minutes  
- Copyright claim filed  
- Monetization assigned to rightsholder

# 3. AI-Generated Content Experiments

## AI Experiment 1 — AI Song Using “Blank Space” Lyrics (Style Mimicry)

**Prompt:**  
Provided the copyrighted lyrics to *Blank Space* to an AI “lyrics-to-music” generator.

**Upload Result:**
- Passed copyright checks entirely  
- No Content ID claim  
- AI audio was not detected at all  



**Observation:**  
This uses copyrighted lyrics and imitates Taylor Swift’s musical style, yet YouTube detected nothing.

---

## AI Experiment 2 — Direct Imitation Video (“spiderman swinging through nyc”)

**Prompt:**  
“spiderman swinging through nyc”

Generated AI footage imitating a copyrighted character.

**Upload Result:**
- Passed all copyright checks  
- No visual match  
- No indication of detection



**Observation:**  
Despite clearly copying a protected character, the AI output bypassed Content ID entirely.

---

## AI Experiment 3 — AI Song + Copyright-Free Background Video (Control Case)

**Description:**  
Uploaded another AI-generated “Blank Space-style” song with a free stock background video.

**Result:**
- Passed checks  
- No Content ID match

# 4. Legal Analysis

## Fair Use Four-Factor Analysis (Gaga Clips)

### 1. Purpose and Character  
- Raw clips are not transformative → weighs *against* fair use  
- Voiceover adds commentary but still uses expressive audiovisual elements → mixed  

### 2. Nature of the Work  
- Music videos are highly creative → *against* fair use  

### 3. Amount/Substantiality  
- Even 10 seconds may include the “heart” of the work (*Harper & Row v. Nation*)  

### 4. Market Effect  
- Uploading music replaces legitimate consumption → *against* fair use  

**Conclusion:** Detection aligns with copyright law.

## AI Experiments Fair Use Analysis

### AI Taylor Swift-style Song
1. Purpose/Character: somewhat transformative but derivative  
2. Nature: based on highly creative underlying work  
3. Amount: melody/harmony differ; lyrics identical  
4. Market Effect: does not substitute the original

Legally questionable, yet **YouTube allowed it with no detection**.

---

### AI Spider-Man Video
1. Purpose/Character: non-transformative recreation  
2. Nature: fictional character = strong protection  
3. Amount: copies essential expressive elements  
4. Market Effect: could cause confusion or reduce licensing value  

Under copyright law, this is **likely infringing**, yet YouTube took no action.

---

## Relevant Case Law

- **Campbell v. Acuff-Rose (1994)** — transformative parody protected  
- **Harper & Row v. Nation (1985)** — small amounts can be infringing if they contain the “heart”  
- **Authors Guild v. Google (2015)** — transformation and new purpose are key  
- **Warhol Foundation v. Goldsmith (2023)** — transformation alone is not enough  

### Application
Content ID correctly flagged the Gaga clips.  
But **AI imitations of Spider-Man and Taylor Swift arguably violate these cases** yet face *zero enforcement*.

# 5. Gap Analysis: Law vs Platform Policy vs Reality

### Legal Theory
- Copyright protects expressive elements, characters, lyrics, voices.
- Fair use is narrow and context-dependent.

### Platform Policy
- YouTube claims to protect copyrighted material.
- Fair use is technically allowed but **not evaluated by Content ID**.

### Actual Enforcement
- Human-created copyrighted clips are detected instantly.
- AI-generated imitations (songs and characters) bypass Content ID completely.
- Style copying and character likenesses go undetected.

### Conclusion
There is a clear enforcement gap:

1. **Copyright Law** would consider AI imitations problematic.  
2. **YouTube Policy** asserts copyright protection.  
3. **Actual Enforcement** ignores AI-generated mimicry almost entirely.
